# bary-polytopes

This MATLAB functions calculate barycentric coordinates for points inside convex polytopes in arbitrary dimensions (In theory. In practise it will get really complicated, really quickly). They use for the Maximum Entropy Coordintes the algorithm by Hormann and Sukumar (2008), and for the Mean-Value ...
There are also some test methods that check the theoretical properties of barycentric coordinates (Positivity, Partition of Unity and Linear Precission).

This project is part of a Seminar coordinated by the Chair for Robotics and Embedded Systems of the Department of Informatics of the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
